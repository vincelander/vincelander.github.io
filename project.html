            The main objective of this project is to develop a web scraper tailored to extract comprehensive and current data on S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia. This project aims to automate the data collection process, thereby improving both the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. 
            Implementing this technology and process in a business context that currently gathers data manually will eliminate inaccuracies. Additionally, this automation will significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection, allowing resources to be allocated to more strategic tasks. This will positively impact our metrics when using the data for insights and decision-making.

            In this paper, the developers researched and studied agriculture domain and focused on the palay production because almost of the Philippines’ residents consume rice in everyday life. For the said statement, the developers have researched that the volume of palay production in the Philippines increases quarterly and yearly but the demand for it also increases much more than the palay production’s increase rate. This is because of the fast and quick growing population of the Philippines, that is why the country is not self-sufficient enough in palay production to sustain the consumption demand of the country. This IT Project paper provides statistics with regard to the focused topic of the developers, this intends to identify that the topic is indeed a critical area to focus on. The developers chose Bulacan in particular with the municipality of Pandi and selected some palay farmer from the 22 barangays as the respondents for the proposed study and system to be able to test and evaluate. The data that were processed in this study were requested at and were provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority. Then the said data was pre-processed through data cleansing and data transformation was processed after for training a predictive model in a machine learning algorithm to identify a prediction model based on the historical data gathered. Then the identified prediction model was validated and evaluated before applying the prediction model identified in a web-based system named Rice Production Prediction Volume and Sufficiency Identification System. This was to be able to predict rice production volume for us to help farmers and those of in the agriculture domain in particular with palay cultivators to formulate and produce better decisions with regards to palay sufficiency. Then the system was evaluated based from the ISO 9126 characteristics using survey questionnaires.

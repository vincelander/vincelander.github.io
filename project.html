            The main objective of this project is to develop a web scraper tailored to extract comprehensive and current data on S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia. This project aims to automate the data collection process, thereby improving both the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. 
            Implementing this technology and process in a business context that currently gathers data manually will eliminate inaccuracies. Additionally, this automation will significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection, allowing resources to be allocated to more strategic tasks. This will positively impact our metrics when using the data for insights and decision-making.

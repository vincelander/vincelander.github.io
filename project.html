        <b>WEB SCRAPER</b>
        <br>
        The primary goal of this project is dedicated to the creation of a web scraper specifically designed to retrieve comprehensive and up-to-date data on S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia. This aims to automate the data collection process, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval.
        With this technology and process, the output if we implement it in a business use case that gather's data manually makes no room for innaccuracy of data. This also impacts our metrics if we are using the data for insights and decision.

            In this project, the development team conducted extensive research within the agricultural sector, specifically focusing on rice (palay) production, given its significance as a staple food consumed daily by the majority of the Philippine population. The findings indicate that while the volume of palay production in the Philippines has been increasing on a quarterly and yearly basis, the demand for rice is growing at a much faster rate. This discrepancy is largely driven by the rapid population growth in the country, leading to a lack of self-sufficiency in palay production to meet national consumption needs.
            This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis and statistical insights into this critical issue. The research was centered Region III (Central Luzon), particularly the municipality of Pandi, where selected palay farmers from 22 barangays participated as respondents. Data utilized in this study were obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority and underwent rigorous preprocessing, including data cleansing and transformation.
            To develop a predictive model, machine learning algorithms were employed, leveraging the historical data gathered. This model was subsequently validated and evaluated before being integrated into a web-based platform named the Rice Production Volume and Sufficiency Identification System. The goal of this system is to provide actionable predictions regarding rice production volumes, thereby assisting farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural sector, particularly those involved in palay cultivation, in making informed decisions related to production sufficiency.
            The effectiveness of the system was assessed based on the ISO 9126 quality characteristics, utilizing survey questionnaires to gather user feedback.

            The main objective of this project is to develop a web scraper tailored to extract comprehensive and current data on S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia. This project aims to automate the data collection process, thereby improving both the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval. 
            Implementing this technology and process in a business context that currently gathers data manually will eliminate inaccuracies. Additionally, this automation will significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection, allowing resources to be allocated to more strategic tasks. This will positively impact our metrics when using the data for insights and decision-making.
